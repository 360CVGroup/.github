## :wave: Who We Are

This is the [360 AI Research](https://research.360.cn/), our mission is to **lead in tech innovations and deliver real-world values**.     
We focusÂ onÂ **"multimodal + cross-modalÂ learning"**Â andÂ **"largeÂ model + zero/fewÂ shotÂ learning"**,    
conductingÂ researchÂ in
* ### :mag_right: multi-modal comprehension
  * [**FG-CLIP**](https://github.com/360CVGroup/FG-CLIP): ICML2025, new generation of CLIP with strong fine grained discrimination capability
  * [**LMM-Det**](https://github.com/360CVGroup/LMM-Det): ICCV2025, make large multimodal models excel in object detection
  * [**IAA**](https://github.com/360CVGroup/Inner-Adaptor-Architecture): AAAI2025, LMM with plugin mechanism solving catastrophic forgetting
